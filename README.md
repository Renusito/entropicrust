## Introduction

Chaos theory studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. This sensitivity means that small changes can lead to vastly different outcomes, a phenomenon often referred to as the "butterfly effect." **Entropicrust** aims to simulate these systems, providing users with tools to visualize and understand complex behaviors.

The project leverages Rust's performance and safety features, making it an excellent choice for high-performance simulations. Whether you are a researcher, educator, or enthusiast, this project can help you explore the intriguing aspects of chaos.

## Features

- **High-Performance Simulations**: Built with Rust, ensuring efficient computation.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive visual representations of chaotic systems.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands to run simulations and visualize results.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help you get started.
- **Open Source**: Contribute and collaborate with the community.

## Installation

To get started with **Entropicrust**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Renusito/entropicrust.git
   cd entropicrust
   ```

2. **Install Rust**:

   If you haven't installed Rust yet, follow the instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

3. **Build the Project**:

   Once Rust is installed, build the project using:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:

   After building, you can run the application with:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Usage

Using **Entropicrust** is straightforward. After installation, you can run simulations with simple commands. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

1. **Choose a System**: Select the chaotic system you want to explore. For example, the logistic map or the Lorenz attractor.
  
2. **Set Parameters**: Input the parameters for your chosen system. These might include initial conditions, time steps, and other relevant variables.

3. **Run the Simulation**: Execute the simulation command. The program will compute the results and generate visualizations.

4. **Analyze Results**: Review the output. You can save visualizations for further analysis or share them with others.

## Examples

Here are some examples of chaotic systems you can simulate using **Entropicrust**:

### Logistic Map

The logistic map is a classic example of how complex, chaotic behavior can arise from very simple nonlinear dynamical equations. You can simulate it using the following command:

```bash
cargo run -- logistic_map --r 3.8 --x0 0.5 --steps 100
```

### Lorenz Attractor

The Lorenz attractor is a system of ordinary differential equations that models atmospheric convection. To simulate it, use:

```bash
cargo run -- lorenz_attractor --sigma 10.0 --rho 28.0 --beta 8.0/3.0 --steps 1000
```

### Double Pendulum

The double pendulum is a simple mechanical system that exhibits chaotic behavior. Run the simulation with:

```bash
cargo run -- double_pendulum --length1 1.0 --length2 1.0 --mass1 1.0 --mass2 1.0 --steps 500
```

Each of these examples will produce visualizations that you can explore and analyze.
